🏆 Sports Scheduler
A web-based application designed for managing sports sessions, allowing users to register, log in, create, and join sessions. The system supports two types of users: Admins and Players.

Admins can manage sports, schedule sessions, and generate reports, while players can browse, join, and leave sports sessions. The project is built using Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and EJS, ensuring a robust and scalable solution for managing sports activities.

📌 Features
User Authentication – Secure login and registration system with password hashing.
Admin Dashboard – Create, delete, and manage sports sessions.
Player Dashboard – View and join available sports sessions.
Session Management – Admins can create, cancel, and delete sessions. Players can join or leave sessions.

Set Up PostgreSQL Database

Create a new PostgreSQL database (e.g., sports_sessions).
Update the database.js file with your PostgreSQL connection credentials.
Run the following SQL commands to create the necessary tables:

CREATE TABLE users (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(100),
email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
role VARCHAR(50) CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'player')) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE sports (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE sessions (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
sport_id INT REFERENCES sports(id),
creator_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
team1 VARCHAR(100),
team2 VARCHAR(100),
additional_players INT DEFAULT 0,
date TIMESTAMP,
venue VARCHAR(255),
cancelled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
cancellation_reason TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE session_players (
session_id INT REFERENCES sessions(id),
player_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
PRIMARY KEY (session_id, player_id)
);
Start the Server
